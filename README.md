READ THIS BEFORE WORKING PLEASE :)

If you are editing a file, please send a message to the group chat in the format of:

"FILE_NAME - START"

to indicate that the file is being edited and to prevent forking. Similarly, when you have finished editing the file and the edits are pushed to the repo (and only when the edits are pushed to the repo), send a message to the group chat in the format of:

"FILE_NAME - STOP"

Following this protocol and keeping open communication on edits is vital for the health of the repo, and preventing issues with differing code versions.
In a similar vein, always ensure that you pull from the repo before making any edits whatsoever, or it may cause issues.

Please make sure that you use commit messages to the fullest, describing in reasonably concise detail what work was done on the file(s) in question.

If you have any questions, please ask Kieran ASAP and he'll do his best to help you.
This README will be updated if any additional guidelines are added.
